.br
.sp
The following default option values will be provided:
.br
.sp
.RS
-o none -f none -v 1 -t 30
.br
-l 1024                        for data
.br
-l 16                          for interrupt
.br
.RE
.sp
If remote is not specified it will connect to DTR on the local system.
.br
.sp
In some cases it may be necessary to pass access control information so that
the remote DTR runs in the correct system context. Both VMS and Ultrix style
access control formats are supported:
.br
.sp
.RS
node"user password"::
.br
node/user/password::
.RE
.sp
The "::" may be omitted.

.SH DESCRIPTION
dts connects to the DECnet Test Receiver (DTR, object 63) on the remote
system and performs the requested test operation via the DECnet socket
interface. accept/reject/disc/abort tests perform a single operation while
data/interrupt repeatedly transmit data until the requested duration has been
exceeded or an error is detected.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 20
.I "\-o none|std|rcvd"
Controls how the DECnet Test Receiver (DTR) will return optional data to DTS
for accept/reject/disc/abort tests. "\fInone\fP" does not return any optional
data, "\fIstd\fP" returns a standard format ("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP") and
"\fIrcvd\fP" returns the same data it received on the initial connect.
.TP 20
.I "\-f none|seg|msg"
Requests the remote DTR to use the specified flow control mechanism when
returning data messages to DTS. "\fInone\fP" uses SEND/DONOTSEND flow control,
"\fIseg\fP" uses segment flow control and "\fImsg\fP" uses message flow
control. Note that the remote DTR may ignore this request if it is unable to
support the requested flow control method (Linux only supports "\fInone\fP").
.TP 20
.I "-v n"
If the "\-f seg|msg" is used, this value is sent to the remote DTR as the
default number of segments or messages which may be sent.
.TP 20
.I "\-l n"
Controls the size of the data/interrupt messages to be sent. Data messages are
limited to a maximum of 4096 bytes and interrupt messages are limited to a
maximum of 16 bytes.
.TP 20
.I "\-r sink|seq|pat|echo"
Controls how DTS contructs data/interrupt messages and DTR processes incoming
messages. "\fIsink\fP" causes DTR to discard any messages it receives. For the
other 3 cases, DTS places a sequence number (starting at 1) in the first 4
bytes of the data and DTR checks to make sure the packets are received in the
correct order. "\fIseq\fP" just performs a simple sequence check, "\fIpat\fP"
causes DTS to fill the remainder of the data message with a standard value
("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789") and DTR will validate that the
entire message is correct. "\fIecho\fP" operates similar to "\fIpat\fP" but
DTR will also transmit the message back to DTS.
.TP 20
.I "\-s"
Controls whether DTS will output statistics for data/interrupt tests
indicating how many messages were transmitted/received, how much data was
transmitted and the message and data transmission rates.
.TP 20
.I "\-t n"
Controls how long the data/interrupt tests will run (in seconds).
